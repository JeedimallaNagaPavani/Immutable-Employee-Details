# Immutable-Employee-Details

# Immutable Employee Management

📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple web-based application where users can enter Employee details such as name, ID, date of joining, and two addresses. Once the details are submitted, an immutable Employee object is created using JavaScript's Object.freeze() method, ensuring that the details cannot be modified after creation. The details are then displayed on the web page.
